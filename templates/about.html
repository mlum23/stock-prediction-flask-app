            Predictions are being made with a simple linear regression model. Every time a submission
            is made, the backend is creating a model with a 80-20 train-test split on the
            <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/"> Yahoo Finance</a> stock data going back up to 5 years. That is,
            80% of the dataset (chosen randomly) is used for training the model, while the other 20% is used for
            validating the model.

            Some advantages of linear regression is that it is simple to implement and is computationally
            efficient. Some disadvantages include being prone to outliers and underfitting.
